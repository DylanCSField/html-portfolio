<h1>The best movies according to Dylan Mercado</h1>
<h2>My top 3 favorite movie series of all time</h2>

<hr /> 

<h3>Spider-man</h3>
<p>Spider-man has been my favorite superhero for years and years. As such, I have greatly enjoyed any and all Spider-man movies.</p>

<h3>Saw</h3>
<p>The saw movie series contained entertaining content through every minute of all films, yet still managed to best it all towards the end of each movie with the series' consistent surprising endings.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>I had watched all of the Harry Potter movies when I was 8 years old, and I thoroughly enjoyed the entirety of the story development across the whole of the lengthy series.</p>
